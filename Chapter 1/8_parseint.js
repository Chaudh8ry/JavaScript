/*
While both functions serve to convert strings to numbers, there are subtle differences between Number.parseInt() and parseInt():

1. Syntax:

Number.parseInt(): It's a method of the Number object, called as Number.parseInt(string, radix).
parseInt(): It's a standalone function, called as parseInt(string, radix).
2. Global vs. Local:

Number.parseInt(): It's always available as a method of the Number object.
parseInt(): It's a global function, so it might be overwritten or unavailable in certain environments (e.g., strict mode).
3. Implicit Number Conversion:

Number.parseInt(): If the input is already a number, it returns the same number without conversion.
parseInt(): If the input is already a number, it converts it to a string first and then parses it.
4. Handling Leading Zeros:

Number.parseInt(): Treats leading zeros as part of the numerical value (e.g., Number.parseInt("010") returns 10).
parseInt(): Ignores leading zeros when the radix is 10 (e.g., parseInt("010") returns 1).
5. Handling Undefined or Null:

Number.parseInt(): Returns NaN when the input is undefined or null.
parseInt(): Throws a TypeError when the input is undefined or null.
Generally:

Number.parseInt() is preferred for clarity and consistency, especially in modern JavaScript.
It's less likely to be affected by environment-specific variations.
Key Points:

Both functions convert strings to integers.
Number.parseInt() is a method, while parseInt() is a standalone function.
Number.parseInt() is generally preferred for its clarity and reliability.
Be mindful of the radix (number system) when parsing.
Consider how they handle leading zeros, undefined/null values, and existing numbers.

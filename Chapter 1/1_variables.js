// Js is a "Dynamic Typed Language" - we can change the type of any variable in run time.
// Language like 'C' is "Static Type Language" - we have to first declare the variable whether it is a Integer,String,Floating Point Number or character etc. | it does not allow to change the type of any variable in runtime.
// now "let" is used to declare variables in Js earlier "var" was used
console.log("Hola Amigo, Mucho Gusto");

//Below Here 'a' is "Identifier" - Name given to a variable
// '8' is the "Literal" - Actual value stored in a variable
// combination of Identifier and Literal is Variable
// *  Identifiers are for naming and distinction, while variables are for storing and manipulating values
let a=8; // variable 'a' contains value 8
console.log(a); // print value of 'a'


a = "harry" // here variable type changed e.g. of "Dynamic Typed Language"
console.log(a);

Autoboxing allows premitive DataType to behave like objects and use methods that are typically available only to objects.

let text = "hello";
console.log(text.toUpperCase()); // Outputs: "HELLO"

Here, text is a primitive string. When you call toUpperCase(), JavaScript temporarily wraps the 'text' in a String object so that the method can be called. This temporary object is then discarded after the method call.

Autoboxing makes it convenient to work with primitive values as if they were objects, providing access to useful methods without requiring explicit conversion.

*Autoboxing doesnt work with 'NULL' and 'UNDEFINED', it can work on String,Number,Boolean
